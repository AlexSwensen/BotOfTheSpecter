# Changelog - Version 3.6 (2024-04-01)

## Added
- Implemented the `clip` command, allowing users to create clips from the Twitch stream when online. The command generates a clip URL and sends it to the chat. Additionally, it creates a stream marker for the clip.

- Introduced the `marker` command, which enables moderators and the broadcaster to create stream markers with custom descriptions. These markers are used to denote important moments during the stream.

- Implemented the `subscription` command, accessible via the aliases `mysub`. This command allows users to check their subscription status to the Twitch channel. It retrieves subscription information using the Twitch API and provides details such as subscription tier and gifter information if applicable.
