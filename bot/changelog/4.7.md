## Changelog - Version 4.7 (2024-09-19)

## Enhancements & Updates
- **API Token Management:**
  - Updated `VERSION` variable to "4.7" to track the bot version.
  - `WEATHER_API` removed as it's no longer needed as it's now done via the Specter API.

- **WebSocket Connection Enhancements:**
  - Added functionality for connecting to the Specter WebSocket server (`specter_websocket()` method).
  - Handled events for:
    - Connection to the WebSocket server (`@sio.event connect`).
    - Disconnection from the WebSocket server (`@sio.event disconnect`).
    - Receiving messages from the WebSocket server (`@sio.event message`).
        - Stream events: `STREAM_ONLINE`, `STREAM_OFFLINE`, `FOURTHWALL` and `WEATHER_DATA`.
    - Introduced retry logic with sleep for WebSocket reconnections.

## Command & Event Improvements
- **Gift Sub Event:**
  - Updated the processing of `is_anonymous` and `cumulative_total` within the `process_giftsub_event()` function.

- **Fourthwall Event Processing:**
  - Added functionality to handle Fourthwall events with various event types such as:
    - `ORDER_PLACED`: Logs details about orders placed, including the item, quantity, and total price. Sends a notification message to the channel.
    - `DONATION`: Logs donations and includes any message from the donor. Sends a notification message to the channel.
    - `GIVEAWAY_PURCHASED`: Logs purchases of giveaway items and tracks the status and winner of each gift. Sends a notification message to the channel for each gift.
    - `SUBSCRIPTION_PURCHASED`: Logs new subscriptions and sends a notification message to the channel about the subscription details.

- **Todo Command:**
  - Added a new `todo` command to manage a user's personal todo list with the following actions:
    - **Add**: Users can add tasks with an optional category.
    - **Edit**: Users can edit existing tasks by specifying the task ID and new description.
    - **Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete.
    - **Remove**: Tasks can be marked for removal, pending user confirmation.
    - **Confirm**: Confirms pending task removal.
    - **View**: View details of a specific task using its task ID.
  - The command ensures proper validation of inputs and permissions for certain actions like adding, editing, and removing tasks.
  - Database operations for `todos` and `categories` are now included for task management.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Improved error handling and logging for `event_command_error` when commands are on cooldown.
  - Commands now notify users if they attempt a command that is still on cooldown.
  - Added error logging for key errors and unexpected exceptions during event processing.

- **Weather Command Overhaul:**
  - Refactored the `weather_command` to pull weather data directly from the Specter API using the location information provided in the request.
  - Added support for API request failure with proper logging.
  - Removed the redundant manual logic for fetching weather and sending WebSocket notifications.

- **Kiss Command:**
  - Improved fetching and logging of `kiss_count` for the target user.
  - Cleaned up redundant code and streamlined the fetching of `kiss_count` from the database.

## Other Notable Changes
- Removed unnecessary imports and cleaned up code structure, such as:
  - Removal of the `as commands` in the `twitchio.ext import commands` import.
  - Import simplification across different modules.

- **System Improvements:**
  - Added cooldown rates for commands to manage command spam.
