# Changelog - Version 3.14.2 (2024-04-21)

## Changed
- **timed_message function**: 
  - Replaced the condition `if message in scheduled_tasks` with `if any(task.get_name() == message for task in scheduled_tasks)`.
    This ensures proper checking if a message is already scheduled by comparing message content, not tasks themselves.
  - The previous comparison could not accurately determine if a message was already scheduled, as it directly compared the message with scheduled tasks, which are task objects.

## Added
- **timed_message function**:
  - Added a set_name method to tasks created, using `task.set_name(message)` after task creation.
    This allows easy identification and management of tasks by associating each task with its corresponding message.
  - Setting a name for the task enhances clarity and simplifies debugging or monitoring of scheduled tasks.

## Note
- **send_timed_message function**:
  - No changes were made to the send_timed_message function.
    It continues to handle sending timed messages with appropriate error handling, awaiting the specified delay before sending the message.
    Error handling remains intact, catching exceptions such as asyncio.CancelledError to handle task cancellation gracefully.
