# Changelog - Version 3.6.2 (2024-04-04)

## Hotfix

- Fixed an issue in the clip command where the status code check was incorrect. Previously, it erroneously checked for a `200` status code, which has now been updated to correctly check for `202`.
  
- Enhanced logging clarity:
  - Updated the log message from `"Failed to create a stream marker."` to `"Failed to create a stream marker for the clip."` for better specificity.
  - Changed the error log message from `"Status code: {clip_response.status_code}"` to `"Clip Error Code: {clip_response.status_code}"` for clearer information.
