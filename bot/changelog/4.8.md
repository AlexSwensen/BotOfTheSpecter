## Command & Event Improvements
- **Ko-Fi Event Processing:**
    - Added functionality to handle Ko-Fi events for various event types:
        - **Shop Order**: Logs order details, including the item, quantity, and total price, and sends a notification message to the channel.
        - **Donation**: Logs donations, including any message from the donor, and sends a notification message to the channel.
        - **Subscription**: Logs new subscriptions and sends a notification message to the channel about the subscription details.

- **Ping Command:**
    - Edited the ping command to provide a clearer explanation in chat about what the command does and how it's used.

- **New Sound Alert System:**
    - Custom-built Sound Alert System.
    - Map channel points to audio files uploaded on the dashboard.
    - Use the overlay to hear sound alerts in OBS.

- **New Channel Point Process:**
    - Added new channel point triggers for:
        - `lotto`: Displays random "lotto" numbers in chat as a fun game.
        - `fortune`: Displays a random fortune for the user in chat.

## Other Notable Changes
- Moved the Twitch Event Sub for `channel.channel_points_automatic_reward_redemption.add` & `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add` from a single function to its own dedicated function called `process_channel_point_rewards`.
- Moved the **Spam Pattern** detection from the code to the database, allowing users to update the spam patterns without restarting the bot.
