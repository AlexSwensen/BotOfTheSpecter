## Changelog - Version 4.2 (2024-05-07)

### Added
- Added `(user)` which allows tagging any user in the custom command.
- Added `(command.)` which allows calling other custom commands in the custom command. For example, `(command.discord)` would call the custom command called "discord".

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue in message counting where the broadcaster's user level was incorrectly identified as a normal user instead of broadcaster.
- Fixed an issue with the `process_raid_event` function where the data from the table wasn't being fetched correctly. If there was existing data in the table, the raid count number and viewer count are adjusted correctly.
- Fixed an issue with the sending of the `discord_alert_online` function where the URL wasn't being found in the table.
- Fixed an issue with the `builtin_commands_creation` function where the commadns wern't being inserted into the table correctly.

### Changed
- Updated the `ad break` wording for better clarity and consistency.
    ```py
    await channel.send(f"An ad is running for {formatted_duration}. We'll be right back after these ads.")
    ```
