## Changelog - Version 5.1 (2024-11-18)

**New Features:** 

* **User Count Variable:** Introduced the `(usercount)` variable for custom commands. This variable allows you to track and display how many times a user has used a specific command. 
* **Heartrate Monitoring:** Integrated with HypeRate to enable heartrate monitoring.
    * A new `!heartrate` command displays the streamer's current heart rate from HypeRate.
    * Requires a HypeRate account and API key configuration.
* **Watch Time Tracking:**  The bot now tracks the watch time of users in the chat, both live and offline.
    * A new `!watchtime` command allows users to see their total watch time.
* **Spotify Integration:** Added Spotify integration to display the currently playing song and request songs.
    * The `!song` command now prioritizes showing the song from Spotify if it's playing.
    * A new `!songrequest` (or `!sr`) command allows users to request songs to be added to the Spotify queue.

**Enhancements & Updates:**

* **Command Permissions:** Updated all built-in commands to include permission settings from the database. This allows for more granular control over who can use each command.
* **To-Do List:**  Improved the to-do list functionality with the following changes:
    * Added the ability to specify a category when adding a task (e.g., `!todo add "Task description" 2`).
    * Updated the `!todo edit` command to require a comma between the task ID and the new description (e.g., `!todo edit 1, New task description`).
    * Added a confirmation step for removing tasks using `!todo remove` followed by `!todo confirm`.
    * The `!todo view` command now displays the category of the task.
* **Stream Marker:** Moved the Twitch stream marker creation logic to a dedicated function for better code organization and reusability.
* **URL Blocking:** Improved the URL blocking feature with a more robust function to match URLs and domains against the whitelist and blacklist.
* **Joke Command:** Added blacklisting functionality to the `!joke` command. Users can now specify categories of jokes they don't want to see.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Weather Command:** Fixed an issue where the `!weather` command would not properly handle invalid or unknown locations. The bot will now inform the user if the location is not found.
