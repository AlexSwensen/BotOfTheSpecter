## Changelog - Version 4.2 (2024-05-07)

### Added
- Added `(user)` which allows tagging any user in the custom command.
```py
if '(user)' in response:
    user_mention = re.search(r'<@(\d+)>', messageContent)
    if user_mention:
        mentioned_user_id = user_mention.group(1)
        # Use mentioned user's name
        user_name = await get_display_name(mentioned_user_id)
    else:
        # Default to message author's name
        user_name = messageAuthor
    response = response.replace('(user)', user_name)
```
- Added `(command.)` which allows calling other custom commands in the custom command. For example, `(command.discord)` would call the custom command called "discord".
```py
if '(command.' in response:
    command_match = re.search(r'\(command\.(\w+)\)', response)
    if command_match:
        sub_command = command_match.group(1)
        mysql_cursor.execute('SELECT response FROM custom_commands WHERE command =(sub_command,))
        sub_response = mysql_cursor.fetchone()
        if sub_response:
            response = response.replace(f"(command.{sub_command})", sub_response[0])
            responses_to_send.append(sub_response[0])
        else:
            chat_logger.error(f"{sub_command} is no longer available.")
            await message.channel.send(f"The command {sub_command} is no longer available.")
```

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue in message counting where the broadcaster's user level was incorrectly identified as a normal user instead of broadcaster.
```py
is_broadcaster = messageAuthor.lower() == CHANNEL_NAME.lower()
user_level = 'broadcaster' if is_broadcaster else 'mod' if is_mod else 'vip' if is_vip else 'normal'
```
- Fixed an issue with the `process_raid_event` function where the data from the table wasn't being fetched correctly. If there was existing data in the table, the raid count number and viewer count are adjusted correctly.
```py
mysql_cursor.execute('SELECT raid_count, viewers FROM raid_data WHERE raider_id = %s', (from_broadcaster_id,))
```
- Fixed an issue with the sending of the `discord_alert_online` function where the URL wasn't being found in the table.
```py
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT discord_alert_online FROM profile")
discord_url = mysql_cursor.fetchone()
```
- Fixed an issue with the `builtin_commands_creation` function where the commadns wern't being inserted into the table correctly.
```py
if new_commands:
    placeholders = ', '.join(['(%s)'] * len(new_commands))
    values = [(command,) for command in new_commands]
    mysql_cursor.executemany("INSERT INTO builtin_commands (command) VALUES " + placeholders, values)
    mysql_connection.commit()
```
### Changed
- Updated the `ad break` wording for better clarity and consistency.
    ```py
    await channel.send(f"An ad is running for {formatted_duration}. We'll be right back after these ads.")
    ```
