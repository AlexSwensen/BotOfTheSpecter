## Changelog - Version 5.2 (2024-12-26)

**Enhancements**

* **Improved data handling:** I've updated all SQL queries to use `aiomysql.DictCursor`, which provides easier data access and improves code readability.
* **Clearer code:** I've renamed the `bot` variable to `BOTS_TWITCH_BOT` (BotOfTheSpecter_TwitchBot) for a more descriptive and informative naming convention.
* **Timezone fix:** The midnight function now includes a default timezone (UTC) if you haven't configured your timezone in your profile settings. This prevents potential errors and ensures the function works correctly for all users.
* **Stream status tracking:** To maintain accurate stream status information even if you restart the bot, we log online/offline events to files.
* **Proper initialization:** I've explicitly initialized the `stream_title` variable to `None` in the global variables section, ensuring proper setup and preventing potential issues.
* **Case-Insensitive Commands:** All commands can now be used with any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters.
* **New Spotify Command - `!songqueue`:** Displays the next 3 songs in the queue and the total number of songs remaining.
* **Enhanced Logging:** Added detailed logging for various events and errors to improve debugging and monitoring.
* **Shoutout Queue:** Implemented a queue system for handling shoutouts to avoid spamming and manage cooldowns effectively.
* **Subathon Management:** Added commands and functions to manage subathon events, including starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming the subathon timer.
* **Weather Updates:** Enhanced the weather command to provide detailed weather information for the streamer's location. **This feature is now available for free.**
* **Heart Rate Monitoring:** Integrated HypeRate WebSocket for real-time heart rate monitoring and display during streams.
* **Custom Command Cooldowns:** Implemented cooldowns for custom commands to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
* **New Custom Variable:** Added `(timeuntil.DATE-TIME)` to show the exact time remaining until a specific date and time. **Example:** `There are (timeuntil.2025-12-25-12-00) until Christmas.` **In Twitch Chat:** `"There are 365 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes until Christmas."`
* **Custom Welcome Messages:** You can now customize the default welcome messages for all users. Additionally, you have the option to disable the welcome message entirely, so no message will be sent to chat.
* **Disable Override:** Sometimes the dev team needs to run commands on your channel. If you have commands disabled, we can't run tests. We've added an option to bypass the disabled commands for testing purposes.
* **Concurrently Running Tasks:** By utilizing `asyncio.create_task`, we can now run multiple tasks concurrently, significantly improving data processing speed and preventing the bot from slowing down.
* **New Internal Command - `!editcommand`:** This command allows your moderators (or any user with the appropriate permissions) to edit custom commands directly via chat.
* **Timed Messages Enhancement:** You can now configure timed messages to be triggered by chat activity. If 15 messages are sent in the chat, the timed message will be sent. If the timer triggers but the message has already been sent, it will be rescheduled.
* **BotOfTheSpecter Moderation Actions:** Moderation actions performed by the bot will now be tagged as "BotOfTheSpecter" in your streamer dashboard, making it clear when the bot has taken an action.

**Bug Fixes**

* **None** (Hopefully! ðŸ˜‰ Let me know if you find any.)
