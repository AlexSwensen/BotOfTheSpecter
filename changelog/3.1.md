# Version 3.1 (2024-03-24)

### Added
- Edited the lurking command to show months lurking if the user has been lurking for more than 30 days.
- Added "checkupdate" command to the mod commands list.
- Added the "raid_data" database table.
- Started adding code for the song command which is coming soon.
- Added `TWITCH_GQL` Token.
- Added `SHAZAM_API`.

### Code Additions
- Added code for the song command:
- From Version 3.0, we introduced the following imports:
  ```python
  import random
  import base64
  import streamlink
  ```

These are utilized in the implementation of the song command to handle audio data and interact with streaming content.

```python
@commands.command(name='song')
async def get_current_song(self, ctx):
    await ctx.send("Please stand by, checking what song is currently playing...")
    try:
        song_info = await get_song_info_command()
        await ctx.send(song_info)
    except Exception as e:
        chat_logger.error(f"An error occurred while getting current song: {e}")
        await ctx.send("Sorry, there was an error retrieving the current song.")
```
