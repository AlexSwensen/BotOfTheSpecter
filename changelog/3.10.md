# Changelog - Version 3.10 (2024-04-09)

### Fixed
- Rolled out a fix for the timed messages not being scheduled and posted to chat during the stream.
    - Added two new imports to fix the timed messages
```py
from asyncio import Task, create_task, sleep
from typing import List
```

### Added
- Added the function for the scheduled tasks for the timed messages.
```py
scheduled_tasks: List[Task] = []
```

### Changed
- The entire timed function
```py
async def send_timed_message(message, interval):
    try:
        await sleep(interval)
        if stream_online:
            channel = bot.get_channel(CHANNEL_NAME)
            await channel.send(message)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    await sleep(interval)

async def timed_message():
    global stream_online
    while True:
        if stream_online:
            cursor.execute('SELECT interval, message FROM timed_messages')
            messages = cursor.fetchall()
            for message, interval in messages:
                time_now = datetime.now()
                send_time = time_now + timedelta(minutes=int(interval))
                wait_time = (send_time - time_now).total_seconds()
                task = create_task(send_timed_message(message, wait_time))
                scheduled_tasks.append(task)  # Keep track of the task
        else:
            # Cancel all scheduled tasks if the stream goes offline
            for task in scheduled_tasks:
                task.cancel()
            scheduled_tasks.clear()  # Clear the list of tasks

        await sleep(300)
```
